### A mental Health Awreness Project

Worthy Nomad is a web page about Mental health awareness.
It consists of general information as well as advice and individual help for the elderly, men,  women, teenagers, children, and workplace mental health issues.

There is a link for people who need help urgently as well as tips to help improve your wellness.

## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è About

This website is my first solo project for the fullstack web design boot camp with Code Intitute.
It is to show learning in HTML, CSS GitHub, VSCode and bootstrap, along with showcasing AI as a tool to assist in the build.

Steps in Preparation

## Wireframe
   This was *initially* done using good old fashioned pencil and paper.

## Users Stories- (to do)





## üèóÔ∏è The Build

With the repository in GitHub and a folder created for VS Code I began by creating the boilerplate using shorthand ! **[TAB]**  then copy and pasted the links to bootstrap.  Then the structure was started using AI.

I enabled the Live Server extension in VSCode so I could track progress in my browser.

#### The Navbar 
This was created with this prompt to co-pilot. 
"create a responsive navbar element with links to home, about, support, tips and GET HELP NOW"
The colour of the GET HELP NOW button was changed from 'danger' to 'warning'. The target was set to _blank and rel to noopener noreferrer to make it open in a seperate page.

I created a logo with chat GPT, edited it, and made that the favicon and the logo on the navbar, using Co-pilot's help to modify the code. I added one of the colours from my colour palette as the background-color of my navbar.

#### Header
I added a header section with a hero image generated using co-pilot.  I then used the hero image to create my colour palette using https://color.adobe.com/create/image.  

#### About Us
The next section created was the About Us section with two headings and paragraphs of text.

#### Tailored Help Section
The 'We are all individual' section was created with the following prompt to co-pilot.
"Ceate section using bootstrap 5 with 6 cards containing header, paragraph and image"
The images were generated using Microsoft co-pilot. 

I hit a challenge on one of the images as I had asked co-pilot to create an image of a sad woman in a kitchen with children at a kitchen table eating dinner. I received this message -
"I can‚Äôt generate that image due to safety policies around depicting distress in domestic settings. If you‚Äôre working on a story or project and need help visualizing a scene or exploring emotional dynamics, I‚Äôd be glad to help in another way."  

So all my images contain happy or neutral looking people.

#### Footer
The footer was created with this prompt - "Create a footer with contact, address, and email elements and links to facebook, twitter, instagram"  

A background-color was chosen for the cards and footer sections from the colour pallete generated earlier.

I wanted to link each of the 6 cards to seperate pages which could be themed differently to reflect the subject more appropriately.  

Using this prompt "how do I make the heading on a card a link to another page" I created the 'Men' page and linked the 'Men' card to that page.
Co-pilot asked "Or if you want the entire card to be clickable, wrap the whole card:" and gave me the code to do this.  This is the code I chose to use.

Underneath the Individual Cards section, I created the 'Support and Useful links' section and the 'Tips for mental Wellbeing' section, to be fleshed out at a later time.

Anchor links were put on each of the Navbar buttons with corresponding id="" on the relevant sections.

HTML pages were added for children, men, women, workplace, pensioners and young adults so that the message could be tailored to different groups.  The navbar and footer were copied over to each page to maintain consistency and continuity accross the site.
