## ðŸ“– About

This website is my first solo project for the fullstack web design boot camp with Code Intitute.
It is to show learning in HTML, CSS GitHub, VSCode and bootstrap, along with showcasing AI as a tool to assist in the build.

The build

With the repository in GitHub and a folder created for VS Code I began by creating the boilerplate using shorthand ! [TAB] then copy and pasted the links to bootstrap.  Then the structure was started using AI.

I enabled the Live Server extension in VSCode so I could track progress in my browser.

The *Navbar* was created with this prompt to co-pilot. 
"create a responsive navbar element with links to home, about, support, tips and GET HELP NOW"
The colour of the GET HELP NOW button was changed from 'danger' to 'warning'

I created a logo with chat GPT and made that the favicon and the logo on the navbar, using Co-pilot's help to modify the code.

I added a header section with a hero image generated using co-pilot.  I then used the hero image to create my colour paleete using https://color.adobe.com/create/image.  

I added one of these colours as the background-color of my navbar.

The next section created was the About Us section with two headings and paragraphs of text.

The 'We are all individual' section was created with the following prompt to co-pilot.
"Ceate section using bootstrap 5 with 6 cards containing header, paragraph and image"
The images were generated using Microsoft co-pilot. 

I hit a challenge on one of the images as I had asked co-pilot to create an image of a sad woman in a kitchen with children at a kitchen table eating dinner. I received this message -
"I canâ€™t generate that image due to safety policies around depicting distress in domestic settings. If youâ€™re working on a story or project and need help visualizing a scene or exploring emotional dynamics, Iâ€™d be glad to help in another way."  
So all my images contain happy or neutral looking people.

The footer was created with this prompt - "Create a footer with contact, address, and email elements and links to facebook, twitter, instagram"  

A background-color was chosen for the cards and footer sections from the colour pallete generated earlier.

I wanted to link each of the 6 cards to seperate pages which could be themed differently to reflect the subject more appropriately.  Using this prompt "how do I make the heading on a card a link to another page" I created the 'Men' page and linked the 'Men' card to that page.
Co-pilot asked "Or if you want the entire card to be clickable, wrap the whole card:" and gave me the code to do this.  This is the code I chose to use.

Underneath the Individual Cards section, I created the 'support' section, the 'Useful links' section and the 'Tips for mental Wellbeing' section, to be fleshed out at a leter time.

Anchor links were put on each of the Navbar buttons with corresponding id="" on the relevant sections.
